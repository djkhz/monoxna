[Mono_Xna] is an open-source implementation of [Microsoft XNA] using [The Tao Framework] for cross-platform rendering through [OpenGL], [SDL] and [Mono]. The Mono.Xna discussion forum is available [http://www.taoframework.com/forum/index.php?board=5.0 here].

== Status ==
Mono.Xna is in early stages right now, but the end goal is to allow XNA projects to be compiled and run on platforms other then Windows, without having to change any code.  You can take a look at [TodoList] for a list of things that need to be worked on.

=== Dependencies ===
There are a number of external libraries that [Mono_Xna] requires to be installed in order to run.  These include:

==== Windows ====
All of the Windows binaries for these packages are available in the latest [Tao] package.
 * [OpenGL] - `opengl32.dll`
 * [SDL_NET] - `sdl.dll, sdl_mixer.dll`
 * [DevIL] - `devil.dll, ilu.dll, ilut.dll`

==== Linux ====
For Debian and Debian-like distro you should have these packages installed :
 * libdevil1c2
 * libsdl1.2debian
 * libsdl-image1.2
 * libsdl-mixer1.2
 * libsdl-ttf2.0-0
 * libgl1-mesa-glx and libglu1-mesa, or you graphics card's vendor drivers (recommended for proper rendering)

Also make sure that each *.dll.config files have good values and are in the same directory that the library's assemblies.

==== Mac ====

Here you have [[Xnb file format]].
