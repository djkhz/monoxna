#summary How to set up development environment

= Introduction =

This page describe the process of the setting up the Mono.Xna development environment. The environment is available [http://code.google.com/p/monoxna/source/checkout here].

= Dependencies =

Mono.Xna is dependent on Tao Framework and the NUnit libraries. The versions referenced in the projects are supplied in ./lib/. To allow for single solution the assemblies should be installed into the GAC instead of referenced directly.

== Linux ==

This approach has been tested in Ubuntu 9.04 and openSUSE 11.1.

Run the following commands in the ./lib/ directory to install the Tao assemblies 
utilized in the project:

{{{
sudo gacutil -i -package taoframework-2.1.0 taoframework-2.1.0/Tao.Sdl.dll
sudo gacutil -i -package taoframework-2.1.0 taoframework-2.1.0/Tao.OpenGl.dll
sudo gacutil -i -package taoframework-2.1.0 taoframework-2.1.0/Tao.DevIl.dll
}}}

Copy the taoframework-2.1.0.pc file from ./lib/ to /usr/lib/pkgconfig to make the assemblies available under Packages in MonoDevelop.

The NUnit library version 2.4.8 is the default version in the current stable Mono, but Ubuntu only offers packages for 2.4.7. The following commands can be used to install the correct version.

{{{
sudo gacutil -i -package nunit-2.4.8 nunit-2.4.8/nunit.core.dll
sudo gacutil -i -package nunit-2.4.8 nunit-2.4.8/nunit.core.interfaces.dll
sudo gacutil -i -package nunit-2.4.8 nunit-2.4.8/nunit.framework.dll
}}}

Copy the nunit-2.4.8.pc file to /usr/lib/pkgconfig to finish up.

Scripts will eventually be added to make the installation easier.

== Windows ==
Download the Tao.Framework 2.1.0:
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/files/The%20Tao%20Framework/2.1.0/taoframework-2.1.0-setup.exe/download Tao.Framework 2.1.0 Setup Windows]

Start the Tao.Framework-Setup.

Download NUnit installer version 2.4.8: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunit/files/NUnit%20Version%202/NUnit-2.4.8-net-2.0.msi/download NUnit-Installer 2.4.8]

Start the NUnit installer.

= MonoDevelop & Visual Studio Solution = 

The solution file in the root directory is all that is needed for development in MonoDevelop 2.0. The Visual Studio support needs testing.
