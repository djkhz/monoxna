== Status of Mono.Xna ==

Mono.Xna is in early stages right now, but the end goal is to allow XNA projects to be compiled and run on platforms other then Windows, without having to change any code. For more detail go the [Status] page.

Mono.Xna Contributing Guidelines
================================

1) Never decompile Microsoft binaries to see how they
   work. You cannot contribute if you've done this.

2) Create NUnit tests for everything that you can
   when contributing new code. All methods should be
   tested where possible. A seperate post will be
   written to explain how best to do that.

3) If someone says no, then no means no. They should
   give reasons why code isn't being accepted, if
   they don't, annoy them until they do. If reasons
   are given as to why code isn't being accepted, then
   the code will only be accepted once the relevant
   changes are made. Complaining about it won't help.

4) Have fun.

== Contributing ==

If you wish to contribute to the Mono.Xna project, please take a look at the [Todo todo list], and let us know where you feel you can contribute. An irc channel is also available at #monoxna on the GimpNET irc server for contacting the developers directly

== Subversion access ==

Mono.Xna's source code is kept in the Google Code subversion repository. For more informations click on the `Source` tab. 

NB: if you used previously the Subversion repository located on the Mono Project server please update to this new repository.
