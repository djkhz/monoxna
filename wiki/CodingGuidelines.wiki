#summary How to format the code

= Introduction =

In order for the source code to be consistently formatted despite contributor, we need to follow some style conventions. These conventions are inspired by Mono's [http://mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines coding guidelines] and they should be used as a secondary reference.

= Guidelines =

== Indentation ==

Mono use 8-space indentation, but this creates a lot of whitespace. 4-space indentation is the default setting in both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop, and due to this fact a more natural choice for the preferred indentation style in the monoxna source code.

== Spaces ==

Use a space before an opening parenthesis when calling functions, indexing, loops and tests, like this: 

{{{
Call (param);
index [0];
if (true) ...
while (true) ...
}}}

== Brackets ===

Brackets should be placed on a new line for methods, loops and tests:

{{{
Method ()
{
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        ...
    }

    if (true)
    {
        ...
    }
}
}}}

Properties have their opening brackets on the same line. This applies to multiline *get* and *set* methods as well.

{{{
int Property {
    get { ... }
    set { ... }
}
int Property {
    get {
        ...
    }
    set {
        ...
    }
}
