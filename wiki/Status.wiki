#summary Status of the project

= Introduction =

This page contains the current status of the project, and should be the best place to find new things to fill up your everyday existence. But at the present time it's obviously lacking in helpful information.

= Status = 

The project has been dead for a while and as a result the current status is not clearly defined. From initial browsing through the code it seems that most of the work has been done in regards to input, audio and two dimensional graphics. 

The status of the different components will be posted when it has been determined. For more detail on what needs to be done, check out the [Todo todo list].

== Graphics ==

The 2D graphics interface: SpriteBatch is operational. Simple 2D games have been tested with positive results.

The GraphicsDevice implementation has not yet really been started. There are a couple of problems that must be overcome on the way eg. SDL 1.2 "rough" API.

== Audio == 

There's some information about XACT located [XnaFrameworkAudio here]. 

== Input ==

Undetermined

== Networking ==

Undetermined

== Content Pipeline ==

The development of the content pipeline has been started. Details regarding the status of the content pipeline implementation is posted [ContentPipeline here]
