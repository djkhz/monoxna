#summary Status of the project

= Introduction =

This page contains the current status of the project, and should be the best place to find new things to fill up your everyday existence. But at the present time it's obviously lacking in helpful information.

= Status = 

The following sections will try to introduce the status of the current major areas of our XNA implementation.

== Graphics ==

The GraphicsDevice implementation has not yet really been started. There are a couple of problems that must be overcome on the way eg. SDL 1.2 "rough" API.

=== 2D Graphics ===

The 2D graphics interface: SpriteBatch is operational. Simple 2D games have been tested with positive results.

=== 3D Graphics ===

The 3D Graphics is not yet working at the moment. There are many classes that are placed in code, but most only "templates" (NotImplement).
Some classes need to be added, since MonoXNA started with XNA and XNA changed structure trough versions.
We are trying to implement 3D Primitives at the moment.

== Audio == 

There's some information about XACT located [XnaFrameworkAudio here]. 

== Input ==

The keyboard and mouse is working, but some work needs to be put into getting the gamepad.

== Networking ==

Not implemented at the present moment.

== Content Pipeline ==

The development of the content pipeline has been started. Details regarding the status of the content pipeline implementation is posted [ContentPipeline here]
