This page is structured into open and accepted tasks. The open tasks are open for grabs by any eager contributor while the accepted ones are the tasks for which someone has assumed responsibility.

== Open Task List ==

This section contains the open task list with planned development tasks. This list should _not_ be interpreted as a complete list of remaining work, but more a guide for those who want to contribute without the hassle of finding tasks on their own. The tasks should represent logical groupings, but the can be separated into smaller tasks if desirable.
